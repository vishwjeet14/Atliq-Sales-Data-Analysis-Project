# Introduction

In this project I am doing sales analysis of atalic hardwares.For Data analysis i use Power BI and SQL as a tool. Data is collected from the local Database Mysql.  In sales Database there are five tables present.

* Customer
* Date 
* Market
* Production
* Market

These tables are related each other with primary and foreign keys.
